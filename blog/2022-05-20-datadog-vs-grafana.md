Grafana is primarily used to visualize your time-series database data into meaningful charts from which you can draw insights. Grafana can be used to build an open-source stack for APM, time-series, and logs monitoring. 

In this article, we will compare DataDog with Grafana based on the following categories:

- Getting Started
- Monitoring use-cases
- User Experience
- Pricing

We will also explore the key features of DataDog and Grafana.

## Comparing DataDog and Grafana

The disadvantage of DataDog is that it does not specialize in any one domain. And the good thing about Grafana is that it can be combined with specialized tools for monitoring your application.

The disadvantage of using Grafana is the cost and bandwidth required to maintain it. GrafanaLabs, the company behind Grafana, also offers a cloud version that aims to provide a fully managed observability stack.

Some of the key differences between DataDog and Grafana:

- **Getting started**<br></br>
  You need to sign up for a DataDog account and then install DataDog agents on your host. The DataDog agent can be installed on many platforms either directly or as a containerized version. The agent reports events and metrics from the host.

  For getting started with Grafana, you first need to install it. Check out the different <a href = "https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/installation/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" ><b>operating systems and requirements</b></a> for installation. Once Grafana is installed you can connect it to your desired data source and start visualizing the data.
  
  Some of the popular data sources that Grafana supports are:
    - Prometheus
    - Jaeger
    - Zipkin
    - AWS CloudWatch
    - Graphite
    - Azure Monitor

- **Monitoring use-cases**<br></br>
  DataDog has an extensive list of monitoring services it offers. List of all monitoring products that DataDog provides:
    - Log Management
    - APM
    - Security Monitoring
    - Infrastructure Monitoring
    - Network Monitoring
    
  Grafana can be combined with popular tools for monitoring use-cases:
    - ElasticSearch(for logs)
    - Prometheus(for metrics)
    - Jaeger(for traces)
    
- **User Experience**<br></br>
  With DataDog, everything comes out of the box. Based on the plan you purchase, DataDog provides in-built dashboards and widgets to take care of popular use-cases of monitoring.

  Grafana is a popular open-source analytics and visualization tool. But you need to set up these dashboards and panels which requires some bandwidth. You can build a powerful dashboard by selecting a data source and then combining panels associated with different data sources.

  Another great point to consider is that you can build an open-source monitoring stack using Grafana and other open-source specialized tools meant for monitoring like Prometheus.  You can host this stack within your infra, which takes care of data privacy concerns.

  DataDog is a third-party SaaS vendor and your data will be sent to DataDog cloud for analyses and visualization.

- **Pricing**<br></br>
  The ease of use and the varied use-cases that DataDog provides are not cheap. DataDog is an expensive enterprise monitoring tool that has many different pricing tiers which vary on your use-cases. For example, infrastructure enterprise monitoring starts at $23 per host per month while its APM sand continuous profiler starts at $40 per host per month.

  The open-source version of Grafana comes for free, although you do need to account for the cost of data storage and networking. GrafanaLabs offers paid cloud plans starting at $49 per month, which scale up based on usage.
